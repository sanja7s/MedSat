üñºÔ∏è üì¶ üéØ üîÑ


The __MEDSAT__ dataset serves as a comprehensive resource for public and population health studies in England, encompassing medical prescription quantity per capita as outcomes and a wide array of sociodemographic and environmental variables as features. 
In this release, we provide data snapshots for the years 2019 (pre-COVID) and 2020 (COVID). Sociodemographic variables align with the latest UK census from 2021.

### HOW TO USE THIS CODE

> **STEPS**
1. run the jupyter notebooks from ```environmental_data_extractor``` to obtain environmental indicators.
2. run ```NHS_prescriptions_parser``` to obtain prescrptions for selected conditions.
3. run ```sociodemographic_data_parser``` to obtain sociodemographic indicators from the UK census.
4. ```colate data``` pulls three extracted data sources into a single master file, i.e., __MEDSAT__.
